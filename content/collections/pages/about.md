From a very early age, perhaps the age of five or six, I knew that when I grew up I should be a blogger. It didn’t matter that the internet didn’t yet exist, somehow it was already within me and I knew I would be outraging my true nature to resist. Sooner or later, I would have to settle down and write drivel that nobody would read.

I give all this background information because I do not think one can assess a writer’s motives without knowing something of his early development.

\* _This is of course a parody. For the point, please see Orwell’s first common motive for writing: sheer egoism. That may or may not be the definition of blogging, but either way, please don't take this too seriously. If sharing this stuff (some of my own, but mostly thoughts of others) helps anyone, good; if not, that's also fine…_
