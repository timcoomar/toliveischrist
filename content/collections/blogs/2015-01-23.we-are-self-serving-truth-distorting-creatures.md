*Decades of research in psychology have shown us to be unreliable, distorting, self-serving creatures who routinely reason with prejudice. The very smart are not immune. Indeed, they sometimes seem to be more capable of distortion than others, since they are clever enough to construct whatever argument they need to prop up what they already believe.*
