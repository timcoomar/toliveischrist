*There are vast reaches of experience which are only available to us when we are willing to open our hearts and imaginations to the appeal of beauty, to the deep sense of our kinship with nature and – above all – to the appeal of love. Such experience is experience of reality, and it is only available as we surrender our wills freely to a reality beyond ourselves. Because we are part of the whole fabric of created things, that appeal can only come to us through created things and contingent happenings.*

– Lesslie Newbigin, _The Other Side of 1984_
