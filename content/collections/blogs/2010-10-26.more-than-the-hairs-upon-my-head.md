1. More than the hairs upon my head,
The sinful ways in which I tread
Yet still your mercy never fails;
Your steadfast love, it still prevails.

2. The piercing of your only Son,
Who not one sin had ever done,
Is life to me; the guilty free;
The righteous stricken on that tree.

3. I look to self and fain would weep
At my disgrace; it runs so deep.
I look to Christ and praise your name,
For he has covered all my shame.
