*It is a total myth that man is by nature curious and truth-hungry and wants, above all things, to know. Given certain recognized senses of ‘to know,’ there is in fact a great deal of stuff we do not want to know. Evidence for this is the enormous number of very basic questions and issues we do not want to think about abstractly.*

— David Foster Wallace, *Everything and More*
