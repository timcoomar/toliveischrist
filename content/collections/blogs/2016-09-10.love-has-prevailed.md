Oh show me the place
That's so full of grace
Where those full of fear 
Can dry all their tears
Know fullness of life
Relief from their strife
And walk in the light
Away from the night. 

There is no such place
Apart from your face
No fitting abode
On this lonely road
If you are not there
My burdens to bear. 

Yet see you I do;
The legends are true;
Love has prevailed,
The future unveiled. 
So take now my hand
Next to me stand
And rest in the pow'r
Of Calvary's hour. 

*For Leonidas and Ramona, on their wedding day 10/09/2016*
