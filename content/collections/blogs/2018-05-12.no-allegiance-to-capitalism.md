*One of the results of capitalism that we see developing throughout the nineteenth century is the subservience of **being** to **having**. This result makes allegiance to capitalism virtually impossible for a Christian. For it is not a by-product, something that might not have happened, a result that could be eliminated by a better organization of capitalism. To the contrary, it is the inevitable consequence of capitalism, for there is no other possibility when making money becomes the purpose of life.*

â€“ Jacques Ellul, *Money & Power*
