There it is again, that poker face
Fooling no one, yet revealing nothing
Not even a slight twitch
To give away the presence of a heart...
Only the eyes,
Pointing down then darting quickly up;
A failed attempt at misdirection.
How deep have you buried it,
That hidden treasure of yours?
And who can plumb such depths
With the entrance sealed so tightly shut?
We can sit here until one of us gives way;
Yes, we both know it won't be you,
Or we can pretend like you never get sad
Again.
