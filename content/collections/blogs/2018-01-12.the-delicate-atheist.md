_I have not come to know atheism as a result of logical reasoning and still less as an event in my life: in me it is a matter of instinct.  I am too inquisitive, too questioning, too high spirited to be satisfied with such clumsy answers.  God is a too palpably clumsy answer; an answer which shows a lack of delicacy towards us thinkers._

– Friedrich Nietzsche, _Ecce homo_
