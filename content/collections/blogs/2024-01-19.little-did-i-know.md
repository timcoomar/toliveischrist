As a child
When I was scared of the dark
Little did I know
That a more sinister threat
Lurked beyond the shadows

How in the light of day
You are slowly hollowed out 
By barbed tongues
And frenzied posturing
Leaving nothing but a shell

Plunging you into a darkness
Without shadows
Only shades of souls 
Who have forgotten how to live

There in the dark night of the soul
You long to see
The darting of shadows
Once again. 
Signs of life
In a world fallen into deathly slumber.
