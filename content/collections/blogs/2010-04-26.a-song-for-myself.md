*A song, inspired somewhat by Psalm 17:*

1] A song for myself if I were to write
And speak of my works in which I delight
Confounded my aim before the first clause
For every good deed just acts as a gauze

2] The lion he lurks around those who feel
No shame in their heart, and never would kneel
Before him who reigns in grace on the throne
Devoured they are, they perish alone.

*O faithless self, where can you abide?
In Jesus alone,
In him you must hide. (x2)*

3] “Give ear to my prayer, attend to my cry;
My feet have not slipped, my ways are all right,”
What man could declare: O Lord I am pure!
But he who our punishment chose to endure.

*O faithless self, where can you abide?
In Jesus alone,
In him you must hide. (x2)*

4] The faithful one Christ, who came to his own
Rejected by all, yet still did atone
For all of our faithlessness, our sin
Flung open the gates and takes us within.

*O faithful one, take me in your arms
And by your blood,
grant me heaven’s charms (x2)
