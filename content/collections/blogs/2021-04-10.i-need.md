I need the one who has overcome the world
I need him
I need him now.

I need to know that things won't always be like this
I need to know who will halt the game
I need to know his name.

I need to find a way to trust in people once again
I need to look them in the eye
I need to not want to die.

I need to look upon the world without fear
I need the violence to cease
I need to live in peace.

I need for everybody to just calm down
I need for justice also to be done
I need all our battles to be won.

I need to turn my back on the world of shadows
I need to dare to dream of the light
I need for day to overcome the night.

I need something that I'm told doesn't exist
I need for it to make itself known
I need to feel finally at home.
