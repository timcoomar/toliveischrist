I had a love affair with a man.
We first locked eyes across a crowded courtyard;
A furtive nod, a gesture, a questioning look, 
"Is it ok to smoke here, guv?" (or the equivalent Greek phrase).
Instant connection,
In a manner of speaking.
After several dates, we were ready
For the next step;
We made a website together.
First one, then another,
United in common cause
Against our clients.
It was almost too much to bear,
Or so I thought,
Until he was snatched away;
That was when I learned
What too much feels like.
